Digit Recognition Application

This project is a machine learning–based Digit Recognition Application that identifies handwritten digits (0–9) from images. It demonstrates the practical use of data preprocessing, model training, and prediction using Python.

Features

Recognizes handwritten digits accurately

Uses a trained machine learning model

Simple and well-organized code structure

Easy to run and understand

Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn
